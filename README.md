# Bombus

The game BOMBUS addresses the dramatic decline of our insect population in recent years. Bumblebees (Bombus spp.) are among the species affected. Yet bumblebees fulfill important functions in our ecosystems, for example as pollinators of potatoes, apples, and cherries. However, these "ecological services" to our economy are being severely compromised with the use of pesticides, the decline in plant diversity, and other man-made environmental changes.

Using "gamification" and "storytelling," BOMBUS aims to raise awareness about this problem. In the game, users become bumblebees themselves and take on pollination tasks: They have to carry pollen from one flower to the next, avoiding natural and man-made obstacles.
